Euro 2024 Football Player Position Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the positions of football players in the Euro 2024 tournament based on various player characteristics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we will develop a model that can accurately classify players into their respective positions.

Objectives
To analyze and preprocess data on Euro 2024 football players.
To engineer relevant features for the prediction model.
To develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict player positions.
To interpret the results and provide insights based on the model's predictions.
Data Sources
The dataset used in this project includes player statistics and attributes from various sources, such as:

Player height
Dominant foot (right/left)
Age
Number of goals
Market value
Data Preparation
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features such as height, dominant foot, age, goals, and market value.
Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Methodology
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of the variables. Visualize the data to identify trends and correlations.

Step 2: Feature Engineering
Transform raw data into meaningful features that can enhance the predictive power of the model.

Step 3: Model Development
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search and Cross-Validation.
Step 4: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Select the best-performing model based on these metrics.

Results
The final model will provide predictions on player positions based on the input features. The performance of the model will be evaluated and compared to establish the most effective model.

Conclusion
The project aims to provide insights into the characteristics that influence player positions and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in sports analytics.
